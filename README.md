### DESCRIPTION :
  My final project is an Online Shopping Website like Amazon or ebay. So actually you can create a new acount, after the registeration has been completed you can login to your account. Each new member have $10000. You can buy electronics items and also sell them. After each operation the website will send you automaticly to the balance to see what you have bought and you can also see the total cash that you have and also the total holdings that you have, including all the items that you have bought .
  
  The header has 5 section : Home, Buy,  Sell, Balance, Logout.
  
  In the home you can see all the items that you can buy, and also you will see a slidshow of images about shopping. In the buy section you will see a select tag
you can select the item that you want and after that you can click buy, after that the website will send you automaticly to the balance to see what you have bought. In sell section also you will see a select tag only of items that you have already bought, after chosing one of theme, you can click  Sell, the website will also send you automaticly to the balanc to see what you have sold. 

  And finally if you click in the logout button, the website will send you automaticly to the login page.
  
  ### Explaining database:
  I needed three tables for my database:

- First, table users. Where I put, id, username, hash (for password) and cash, notice that id must be a primary key here.

- Second, table products. I put name_product, price.

- Three, table purchases, I put in this table buyer_id, name_product, price, time.

## About CS50


This is CS50x , Harvard University's introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming for majors and non-majors alike, with or without prior programming experience. An entry-level course taught by David J. Malan, CS50x teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development. Languages include C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript plus CSS and HTML. Problem sets inspired by real-world domains of biology, cryptography, finance, forensics, and gaming. The on-campus version of CS50x , CS50, is Harvard's largest course. 

Students who earn a satisfactory score on 9 problem sets (i.e., programming assignments) and a final project are eligible for a certificate. This is a self-paced courseâ€“you may take CS50x on your own schedule.


## What we have learned
- A broad and robust understanding of computer science and programming
- How to think algorithmically and solve programming problems efficiently
- Concepts like abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development
- Familiarity with a number of languages, including C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript plus CSS and HTML
- How to engage with a vibrant community of like-minded learners from all levels of experience
 - How to develop and present a final programming project to your peers
